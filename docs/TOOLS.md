## Deck intelligence

Parse, validate, build and tune 40–60 card lists against a live banlist.

### `ygo_parse_deck`

Parse a `.ydk` file, a `ydke://` link or raw YDK text into a validated deck.

<sub>USE THIS FIRST when the user supplies a .ydk path, raw .ydk text or a ydke:// link. Parse the deck into card data and validate it; never transcribe the list by hand. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ydkContent` | `string` | no | Raw .ydk text |
| `filePath` | `string` | no | Absolute or relative path to a .ydk file |
| `ydkeUrl` | `string` | no | ydke:// link (e.g. ydke://base64!base64!base64!) |
| `name` | `string` | no | Deck name |
| `format` | `"TCG" | "OCG" | "AE" | "Genesys" | "Master Duel"` | no | Banlist used to validate copy limits (default TCG) (default `"TCG"`) |

### `ygo_check_legality`

Check size, banlist and zone legality for a deck in one format.

<sub>USE THIS for every "is this legal / how many copies can I run / is X banned" question. Checks Main/Extra/Side sizes, banlist copy limits for the requested format (forbidden / limited / semi-limited), and that Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link monsters are only in the Extra Deck. Works from a .ydk path, raw .ydk text, a ydke:// link, or a DeckData object. Never state a banlist status from memory. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deck` | `any` | no | DeckData, a .ydk path, raw .ydk text, a ydke:// link, or a plain card list |
| `input` | `string` | no | Alias for deck (a .ydk path, .ydk text or ydke:// link) |

### `ygo_export_deck`

Convert a deck to YDK text, a `ydke://` link, or both.

<sub>Export a deck as .ydk text, a canonical ydke:// link, or both.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deck` | `any` | yes | Deck data { main: number[], extra: number[], side: number[] } |

### `ygo_find_community_decks`

Live community, tournament and Konami recipe decks with page links and ydke.

<sub>USE THIS when the user wants real decklists that other people published ("show me decks for an archetype", "what are people building", "a tournament list", "official Konami recipe"). Pulls live community/tournament decks from YGOPRODeck, Master Duel Meta and Konami's official card database (Neuron), and returns each deck's canonical page URL plus a ready-to-use ydke:// link. Every deck plugs straight into ygo_check_legality, ygo_deck_cost, ygo_consistency_lab or ygo_optimize_deck — do not retype the list by hand. Never invent a community deck or a deck URL. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

### `ygo_find_combos`

Structured published combos (starting cards + steps) by archetype or card.

<sub>USE THIS for "how does this deck combo / what is the line" questions that need real combo data. Returns structured combos (starting cards + ordered steps) from Master Duel Meta's public combo API, filtered by archetype or by a specific card, each with a source URL. For a combo derived from a list you already hold, pass the deck to ygo_find_synergy_and_combos instead — this tool reports published combos, it does not invent them. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `archetype` | `string` | no | Archetype / deck type (e.g. a deck type name) |

Compares two decks section by section (Main/Extra/Side) and returns shared cards, cards only in A or B, and copy-count differences with an overlap percentage. Accepts .ydk paths, raw .ydk text, ydke:// links or DeckData. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deckA` | `any` | yes | First deck: .ydk path, raw .ydk text, ydke:// link or DeckData |
| `deckB` | `any` | yes | Second deck: same accepted shapes |

### `ygo_find_synergy_and_combos`

Match cards to a stat filter and trace searchers already in your deck.

<sub>USE THIS for "find a card that does X" or "how do I search it" questions.

### `ygo_build_meta_deck`

Build a legal 40–60 card list for TCG, OCG, AE, Genesys or Master Duel.

<sub>USE THIS whenever the user asks you to build, produce or suggest a decklist. Build a tournament-legal deck (40-60 Main, up to 15 Extra, 15 Side) that respects the banlist of the chosen format (TCG, OCG, AE, Genesys, Master Duel), with strategy, staples and a legal list. Every generated list is re-validated (banlist, sizes, Extra Deck placement) before it is returned. If the archetype has no template the tool returns available:false plus availableArchetypes — it never substitutes another deck. Never output a decklist from memory; every card must come from this tool's response.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `archetype` | `string` | yes | Archetype name (e.g. an archetype) |
| `format` | `"TCG" | "OCG" | "AE" | "Genesys" | "Master Duel"` | no | Format (TCG, OCG, Asian-English AE, Genesys, Master Duel) (default `"TCG"`) |

| `targetCount` | `number` | no | Desired Main Deck size (40-60 cards) (default `40`) |

### `ygo_optimize_deck`

Grade staple and hand-trap ratios, then suggest swaps for the format.

<sub>USE THIS when the user asks to upgrade, fix or grade an existing deck. Grade the staple / hand-trap / board-breaker ratio and propose upgrades under the current banlist and meta. Do not propose replacement cards from memory; start from this tool's output. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deck` | `any` | yes | DeckData, a .ydk file path, raw .ydk text, a ydke:// link, or a plain card list |

### `ygo_consistency_lab`

Play opening hands through turn 1 on the real engine: board rate, Extra Deck rate, brick rate.

<sub>Measure what a deck's opening hands actually do. Deals seeded hands through the real ocgcore engine, plays the full first turn with the heuristic AI (the opponent passes) and reports two distinct numbers: anyActionRate (at least one legal action — a very low bar) and engineBoardRate (reached the Extra Deck or kept a monster on the field). Also returns summon/Extra Deck rates, average board size and the most common openers. A measurement, not a win-rate prediction.</sub>

| `seed` | `number` | no | Deterministic seed (default `12345`) |
| `maxSteps` | `number` | no | Engine step safety cap per trial; each trial always stops after turn 1 (default `800`) |
| `opponentMain` | `number | string[]` | no | Opponent Main Deck passcodes/names (defaults to a mirror of your deck; the goldfish opponent never draws) |

### `ygo_matchup_planner`

Turn the live tier list into a field plan and a role-based side deck.

<sub>Turn the live tier list into a field plan: expected frequency by tops, the top decks to prepare for, and a role-based 15-card side skeleton from the format's staple pool. Counter choices are labelled as role heuristics, not proven counters.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `format` | `"TCG" | "OCG" | "AE" | "Genesys" | "Master Duel"` | no | Format (default `"TCG"`) |

Price a deck across markets and show the cheapest combination.

<sub>Price a whole deck across TCGPlayer / Yuyu-tei / TCGCorner, show the cheapest market per card and the potential saving versus the most expensive market. Prices a bounded number of unique cards and marks the result partial rather than inventing numbers (no FX or shipping applied).</sub>

### `ygo_card_dossier`

One call for everything about a card: database, wiki, script provenance, rulings.

<sub>USE THIS FIRST for a full card profile (database record + wiki + script provenance + optional rulings/prices). One call for everything about a card: official database record (stats, text), wiki record (names in 12 languages, Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Database ID, which tabs exist, page URL), script provenance (official/custom/generated/missing), and optional rulings summary and cached prices. Reports per-source status so a partial answer is explicit. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | no | Card name (English) |
| `passcode` | `number` | no | Card passcode |

| `sortBy` | `"price_desc" | "price_asc" | "demand" | "liquidity_adjusted" | "release_desc" | "name_asc"` | no | Sort order. price_* / demand / liquidity_adjusted require the market index; release_desc = newest TCG release first |
| `limit` | `number` | no | Max results (1-50) (default `20`) |

## Rulings and simulation

Read the actual ocgcore Lua script instead of guessing from card text.

### `ygo_judge_card`

Read the ocgcore Lua script and report HOPT, costs, targeting and timing.

<sub>USE THIS for every ruling question about a specific card. Full mechanics adjudication from the ProjectIgnis Lua source: HOPT/SOPT, cost vs effect, targeting, miss timing, Damage Step, negate activation vs negate effect.

### `ygo_script_insights`

Deep script analysis: effect kinds, cost/target/operation pipeline, risks and corpus-wide patterns.

<sub>Deep card-script analysis. `card` mode explains every effect: kind (ignition/trigger/quick/continuous/flip/summon), trigger event, whether the condition/cost/target/operation pipeline is complete, what it costs, whether it targets, reset duration, hard/soft/duel once-per-turn, plus structural risks (missing LoadScript, invalid constants, target without operation, skeleton code) and complexity metrics. `corpus` mode aggregates a whole folder of scripts: effect-kind distribution, most common trigger events and categories, count-limit mix, recurring risks and the worst offenders.</sub>

### `ygo_ensure_script`

Generate a temporary Lua script for cards without one, verify it in the engine, and auto-replace it when the official script appears.

<sub>Manage Lua scripts for cards that have no official one. `from-news` reads a reveal article (e.g. YGOrganization), extracts the card name, artwork URLs, text and stats, assigns a temporary ID and generates the script; `resolve` generates from the cards.cdb text when the card is already in the database. Every generated script is verified by loading it into ocgcore and is automatically replaced by the official ProjectIgnis script as soon as one exists. Returns provenance (manual/custom/official/generated), confidence, recognised patterns, engine errors and the replacedGenerated flag.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `topic` | `"resolve" | "from-news" | "upgrade" | "inventory" | "list"` | yes | resolve = fetch/generate a script for one card; from-news = read a reveal article, extract the card and generate its script; upgrade = sweep every generated script and replace it if an official one exists; inventory = counts; list = generated scripts |

### `ygo_verify_ruling`

Check a ruling claim against the engine and return SUPPORTED / CONTRADICTED.

<sub>USE THIS before asserting any ruling you cannot point at engine evidence for. Verify a ruling CLAIM against the engine. Give a sentence ('Card A negates Card B') and the tool picks a matching scenario (or runs the one you pass), executes it on ocgcore and returns SUPPORTED / CONTRADICTED / INCONCLUSIVE with the observation that decided it. This is how a judge conclusion becomes checkable. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claim` | `string` | yes | The ruling claim to verify, e.g. 'Card A negates Card B' |

### `ygo_ai_benchmark`

Seeded games on the real engine: AI vs passive baseline, or deck A vs deck B with the AI on both sides.

<sub>Benchmark the heuristic duel AI over N seeded games on the real engine, alternating who goes first. aiSide 'alternate'/'A'/'B' = AI vs the passive default responder; aiSide 'both' = deck A vs deck B matchup with the AI piloting both decks (use this to test a custom card or deck change). Returns win rates, average game length and LP remaining. The AI is a policy, not a trained model — treat the number as a sanity check.</sub>

### `ygo_simulate_duel_scenario`

Walk a board state through a chain and report every legal window.

<sub>Analyse a duel scenario in text form: chain order, legality of each activation, cost/target/timing checks, Lua script cross-reference and a judge-style verdict. Heuristic only — use ygo_judge_scenario or ygo_run_duel for real engine execution.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scenario` | `string` | yes | Duel scenario description (e.g. 'Player A activates Card A, Player B chains Card B discarding it, Player A chains Card C targeting Card B in the GY...') |

<sub>Sync live meta data (staples, TCG/OCG banlists, usage metrics) from the YGOPRODeck API.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `forceRefresh` | `boolean` | no | Force re-fetching from remote API even if local cache is fresh |

### `ygo_get_monthly_meta`

Monthly tier list, play rates and staple trends per format.

<sub>USE THIS for any "what is the meta / tier list / share %" question. Live tier list straight from the YugiohMeta API (/api/v1/deck-types/rankings) for TCG and OCG, with share %, total tops, player counts, live staples and freshness evidence. AE/Genesys/Master Duel have no live source. Do not quote a tier list from memory. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `month` | `number` | no | Month to check (1-12; defaults to the current month) (default `11`) |
| `year` | `number` | no | Year to check (defaults to 2026) (default `2026`) |

| `forceRefresh` | `boolean` | no | Force a refresh from the tournament source (default `false`) |

### `ygo_compare_monthly_meta`

Diff two months of meta data: rising decks, falling decks, banlist impact.

<sub>Compare meta movement between two months (e.g. 2026-10 vs 2026-11): rising stars, falling decks and banlist impact.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `monthA` | `string` | yes | First month (YYYY-MM, e.g. 2026-10) |
| `monthB` | `string` | yes | Second month (YYYY-MM, e.g. 2026-11) |

<sub>Check the meta and banlist day by day (YYYY-MM-DD): emergency banlist notices, errata and tournament news from that day.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `date` | `string` | no | Date to check (YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2026-11-03; defaults to today) |

## Market and news

Three markets, one query — rank the whole pool, measure movement, and explain it with news.

### `ygo_check_prices`

TCGPlayer, Yuyu-tei and TCGCorner prices side by side.

<sub>Multi-market price lookup: TCGPlayer (US TCG), Yuyu-tei (JP OCG) and TCGCorner (AE Asian-English). Yuyu-tei is queried with the resolved Japanese card name; when nothing matches, the quote is a search link with price 0 — never a guessed number. This returns one aggregate per card: for per-rarity or per-language printings use ygo_card_printing_prices.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cardName` | `string` | yes | Card name in English |
| `passcode` | `number` | no | Card passcode, if known |

### `ygo_market_query`

Rank the whole pool by price, demand or measured movement, then explain why with news and banlist evidence.

<sub>USE THIS for market questions that are NOT about one named card: "which card is the most expensive", "what is rising", "what is hot under $5", "why did this card's price move". It ranks and filters the entire card pool by price, demand and measured movement, then correlates the result with YGOrganization news, banlist status, release windows and the live meta. For "expensive but actually sellable", use sortBy: "liquidity_adjusted" (price × demand on log scales) instead of raw price. Ranking is US-based (TCGPlayer/Cardmarket via YGOPRODeck) because Yuyu-tei and TCGCorner have no bulk price feed; set includeMarkets to attach their live quotes for the top results (explain does it by default). Use ygo_check_prices only for a single card's shop-by-shop quotes. Never answer "most expensive / rising" from memory: call this and quote priceBasis, confidence and the data caveats. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `intent` | `"top_price" | "movers" | "explain" | "search"` | no | top_price = rank by price (most expensive first); movers = measured price change from daily snapshots; explain = why a card's price is where it is (news/banlist/release/meta); search = filter + rank (default `"top_price"`) |
| `query` | `string` | no | Free-text name/archetype/type keyword, e.g. an archetype name |
| `card` | `string` | no | Card name to explain (intent=explain) |

| `releasedWithinDays` | `number` | no | Only cards released in the last N days (e.g. 90) |
| `minWeeklyViews` | `number` | no | Liquidity floor: keep only cards with at least N weekly views. Use this to drop collector-only cards nobody actually buys (e.g. minWeeklyViews: 1000). |
| `priceBasis` | `"market" | "top_printing" | "floor"` | no | market = typical cheapest copy (default); top_printing = collector printing; floor = cheapest printing (default `"market"`) |
| `sortBy` | `"price_desc" | "price_asc" | "demand" | "liquidity_adjusted" | "release_desc" | "name_asc"` | no | Ranking for intent=search. Defaults to price_desc. |
| `windowDays` | `number` | no | Window for intent=movers (7/30/90) (default `30`) |
| `limit` | `number` | no | Max results (1-50) (default `10`) |
| `includeNews` | `boolean` | no | Attach matching news articles to the answer (default `false`) |
| `includeMarkets` | `boolean` | no | Attach live Yuyu-tei (JPY) and TCGCorner (HKD) quotes. Ranking always uses TCGPlayer/Cardmarket; enrichment covers the top 3 results (explain: the card itself). Defaults to true for intent=explain. |

### `ygo_card_printing_prices`

Per-printing prices by set code, rarity and language — null when no source lists that printing.

<sub>USE THIS for any question about "which printing is cheaper", "how much is the Secret Rare", "KR version price", or comparing rarities of the same card. Returns a per-printing table (set code, set name, rarity, language) where each row has a price ONLY if a source actually lists that printing; otherwise price is null. Covers EN (TCGplayer per-product), JP (Yuyu-tei) and AE (TCGCorner); KR, DE/FR/IT/SP/PT and SC/TC have no public per-printing feed and are returned as price:null with a note. Never infer a price from rarity — call this instead. Do not answer from memory; call this tool first.</sub>

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cardName` | `string` | yes | Card name in English |
| `maxSets` | `number` | no | How many EN sets to inspect (1-20); each set costs 2 upstream requests (default `8`) |

<sub>Full card detail: stats, text, printings, aggregated multi-market prices (TCGPlayer, Yuyu-tei OCG, Cardmarket AE) and Yugipedia links. Per-printing prices are only present when the source reports set_price; a 0 means 'no price for that printing', not 'free'. For any ranking or 'most expensive / rising' question use ygo_market_query instead.</sub>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cardNameOrId` | `string` | yes | Card name (English) or 8-digit passcode |

### `ygo_get_trending_cards`

What the market is buying right now.

<sub>High-demand meta staples with live prices (TCGPlayer/Yuyu-tei/TCGCorner) and live weekly views (YGOPRODeck). Trends derive from live weekly views; tournament share is an editorial estimate. No hardcoded data.</sub>

Render the deck (Main, Extra, Side) as a PNG in Konami Neuron / tournament decklist layout: 10 cards per row, Monster -> Spell -> Trap, banned cards flagged. The picture is attached to this tool's result as an image block and the absolute outputPath is returned — present it to the user and, if the host has a file-preview or open-file capability, open that path in a tab. Do not describe the image from memory; the rendered file is the source.</sub>

### `ygo_test_custom_card`

Check a custom card on the engine: script errors, how often it is used, win rate with vs without it.

<sub>Test a custom/unreleased card on the real engine like a card designer would: (1) script health — the generated Lua loads and resolves without core errors; (2) usage — how often the AI actually summons/activates it over seeded games; (3) impact — deck win rate with the card swapped in vs without, same opponent, seeds and AI, alternating who goes first, with a 95% interval. Without a deck it uses a neutral vanilla shell, which checks that the card works, not its real-deck power.</sub>
