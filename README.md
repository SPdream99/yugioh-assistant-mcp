Most card-game assistants paraphrase card text. This one reads the **Lua script the
game engine actually runs**, and can execute it: `ygo_judge_card` parses
`c<passcode>.lua` from [ProjectIgnis](https://github.com/ProjectIgnis/CardScripts),
and `ygo_judge_scenario` runs a real duel on `ocgcore-wasm` to settle the question.

It ships as a standard MCP server on stdio (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex,
OpenCode, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Cline, Zed) plus a `ygo` CLI for
shell-only agents.

Everything runs locally. Network calls are read-only public APIs, cached under
`data/`; the full source list with licences is in [docs/CREDITS.md](docs/CREDITS.md).

> **Status: beta (0.10.x), under active development.** Bugs are expected and the
> tool surface will change. Check for updates before you rely on it:
> `npx -y yugioh-assistant-mcp@latest --version`, `ygo doctor`, and the
> [releases page](https://github.com/SPdream99/yugioh-assistant-mcp/releases). Pin
> `@0.10.0` when you need a fixed version.

> **Built with AI.** The code, tests and documentation in this repository were
> written almost entirely by AI agents, with human supervision, review and
> hands-on testing by the maintainer. **AI output is not guaranteed to be
> correct.** Treat every answer, ruling and price this tool produces as a lead to
> verify, not as a final authority: check the cited source, the banlist page and
> the market listing before acting on it.

> **Related work.** This project was developed with reference to many related
> open-source projects — Yu-Gi-Oh! MCP servers, deck builders, price trackers,
> ruling tools and MCP infrastructure — to compare approaches and conventions.
> Only the dependencies and data sources listed in
> [docs/CREDITS.md](docs/CREDITS.md) are included; no code was copied from an
> unlisted project.

## Install

Requires Node 24+ (ocgcore-wasm needs JSPI). Python 3 is only needed for PDF, image and DOCX tools.

Package page: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/yugioh-assistant-mcp> ·
Source: <https://github.com/SPdream99/yugioh-assistant-mcp>.

```bash
# 1. one-time data bootstrap: card database, rulebook, judge corpus, Konami deck form
npx -y yugioh-assistant-mcp fetch-data

# 2. wire the server into every AI client detected on this machine
npx -y yugioh-assistant-mcp setup
```

From source:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> yugioh-assistant-mcp
cd yugioh-assistant-mcp
npm install && npm run build
node dist/cli/index.js setup
```

`setup` writes one entry per client and backs up every file it edits
(`.ygo-<timestamp>.bak`). Preview first or target specific clients:

```bash
ygo install --client claude-code,cursor --dry-run
ygo status
ygo uninstall
```

<details>
<summary>Manual MCP configuration</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yugioh-assistant-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\yugioh-assistant-mcp\\dist\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The installer also handles VS Code (`servers`), Codex (`config.toml`), OpenCode
(`mcp.servers`) and Zed (`context_servers`).

| `ygo_matchup_planner` | Turn the live tier list into a field plan and a role-based side deck. |
| `ygo_deck_cost` | Price a deck across markets and show the cheapest combination. |

**Card database** — Search the live card pool by stats, type, race, attribute or archetype.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ygo_get_card` | Look a card up by name or passcode, with Yugipedia cross-references. |
| `ygo_card_dossier` | One call for everything about a card: database, wiki, script provenance, rulings. |
| `ygo_search_cards` | Filter the card pool by ATK, DEF, type, race, attribute, level or archetype. |

**Rulings and simulation** — Read the actual ocgcore Lua script instead of guessing from card text.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ygo_judge_card` | Read the ocgcore Lua script and report HOPT, costs, targeting and timing. |
| `ygo_analyze_lua` | Parse the Lua structure of ANY card script with an AST (luaparse), not just official ones: effects, condition/cost/target/operation, summon procedures (Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link/Pendulum), Effect API calls, constants and simulator-profile warnings. |

| `ygo_judge_scenario` | Run a real duel scenario on ocgcore-wasm and check the judge's expectation against engine evidence. |
| `ygo_ensure_script` | Generate a temporary Lua script for cards without one, verify it in the engine, and auto-replace it when the official script appears. |
| `ygo_verify_ruling` | Check a ruling claim against the engine and return SUPPORTED / CONTRADICTED. |
| `ygo_check_locks` | Detect summon, activation and material locks across a deck and flag conflicts. |
| `ygo_golden_suite` | Replay the golden scenario suite and report which behaviour changed. |

| `ygo_simulate_duel_scenario` | Walk a board state through a chain and report every legal window. |
| `ygo_run_duel` | Run a REAL duel with ocgcore-wasm (ProjectIgnis EDOPro core compiled to WebAssembly): the engine executes the Lua card scripts, handles chain/cost/target/timing and returns the message timeline (draw, summon, chain, LP update, win). |

**Meta and banlists** — Monthly tier data, month-over-month deltas and daily tournament shifts.

| Tool | What it does |

## Data sources

| Source | Used for | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| YGOPRODeck | cards, printings, banlists, decks, staples | global |
| TCGCSV / TCGplayer | per-printing EN prices | EN |
| Yuyu-tei | JP OCG listings | JP |
| TCGCorner | AE listings | AE |
| Cardmarket (via YGOPRODeck) | EUR benchmark | EU |
| Master Duel Meta | Master Duel decks, combos, counters | MD |
| Konami Card Database | official deck recipes, card pages | official |
| Format Library | GOAT / Edison / Fiber decks | retro |
| Yugipedia | 12-language names, rulings, tips, trivia | CC BY-SA 3.0 |
| YGOrganization | reveals and banlist news | news |
| YugiohMeta / YGO Omega | TCG/OCG and Genesys tier lists | meta |
| ProjectIgnis | Lua scripts + ocgcore engine | engine |

**Language coverage is explicit.** EN, JP and AE have live price feeds. KR,
DE/FR/IT/SP/PT and SC/TC do not — those tools return `price: null` with a note,
never a substituted US price or a guess from rarity.

## Reliability

- **Every outbound call goes through one HTTP client**: per-host queue, 250 ms
  spacing for TCGCSV, retry with backoff on 429/5xx, `Retry-After` support.
- **Offline mode**: `ygo call <tool> --offline` or `YGO_OFFLINE=1` fails fast with
  an explicit reason; tools report `available: false` instead of hanging.
- **Freshness evidence**: live answers carry a timestamp, a 0–100 score, a badge
  and a SHA-256 hash over the payload, so a stale cache is visible.
- **No telemetry, no accounts, no server.** Deck data never leaves the machine.
- **Path guard**: file-writing tools refuse to write outside the project or a
  recognised simulator install.

## CLI

## Development

```bash
npm run build          # tsc → dist/
npm test               # end-to-end suites (network required)
npm run test:http      # retry/backoff/rate-limit contract (offline)
npm run test:fixtures  # parser tests against synthetic responses (offline)
npm run test:compare   # deck comparison unit tests
npm run test:pack      # pack → install in a temp dir → MCP handshake
npm run docs           # regenerate tool tables
npm run doctor         # environment check
```

Adding a tool: append to `TOOLS` in [`src/tools/index.ts`](src/tools/index.ts),
give it a category in [`src/cli/tooling.ts`](src/cli/tooling.ts), then
`npm run build && npm run docs`. The README table, both tool references and
`ygo tools` all regenerate from that one array.
