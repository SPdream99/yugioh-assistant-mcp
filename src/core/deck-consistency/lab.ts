/**
 * Deck consistency lab.
 *
 * "Is this deck playable?" is not a question about staples; it is a question
 * about what the opening hand can actually put on the board. This module deals
 * seeded opening hands and runs each one through the real ocgcore engine with a
 * the heuristic policy piloting the first turn (the opponent passes).
 *
 * Two different numbers are reported, because they answer two different
 * questions and used to be conflated:
 *
 *   anyActionRate  — the hand had at least one legal action the goldfish could
 *                    click. This is a *very* low bar: a hand of three set-able
 *                    traps passes it. It is a fail-fast "does the deck function
 *                    at all" check, not a combo metric.
 *   engineBoardRate— the hand actually reached a real board: it Special
 *                    Summoned from the Extra Deck, or it ended with a monster
 *                    on the field. This is the number to quote when someone
 *                    asks "how often does this deck do something meaningful".
 *
 * It is still a measurement, not a prediction: traps, interaction and optimal
 * lines are not modelled. Report it as a lower bound.
